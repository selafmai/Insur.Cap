THE DATA PROBLEM
Incumbent doesn’t have the “touch point” capability  of dataset, to ingest the customer lifestyle data point.

Ok, IoT & wearables might help insurers, but are too costly and still only deterministic through transactional data.

SOLUTION

# Algorithmically driven augmented underwriting
Our platform architecture streamlines LAMs {Large Action/Agentic Model} orchestration processes, predicts risks proactively, and fosters accessible communication (touch point) through chatbot-based UI conversation flow. Multi-modal orchestration for customer UI delivers more/new datasets and data points for augmenting underwriting. The LAM {Large Action/Agentic Model} empower algorithmically driven architecture and process flow decision tree.

The “Assistant” feature is a part of this application, and it allows you to interact with a personal finance bot that can give you advice on retirement planning. The “Thread” feature shows the topic and the messages of the conversation between you and the bot. The “Assistants API” feature lets you run certain commands or tasks using the bot, such as creating a message or using a code interpreter.
